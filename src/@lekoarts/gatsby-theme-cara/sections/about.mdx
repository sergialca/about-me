# About me

I have been working as a frontend developer for more than 4 years and I have learnt that join a team and get involved in a digital project, make it bigger or help to make it better, make sure that the product follows the design, deliver the best user experience to the final user, and be able to explore new technologies that allow me do more with less, is what I love.
